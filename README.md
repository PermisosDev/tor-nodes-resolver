### What is it?
This project aims to detect TOR nodes to discover if the request comes from here.

### How does this work?
The project internally downloads a list of known nodes from [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sammwyy/tor-nodes-resolver/master/assets/nodes.txt), it can also make an HTTP request to query using an API.
